(* In our classroom discussion of abstraction for model checking, there, were
 * some objections that writing and proving an abstraction feels like just as
 * much work as finding an invariant in the first place.  In this pset, we'll
 * examine a kind of abstraction where the payoff is clearer, because the author
 * of the abstraction only needs to think about the effects of the different
 * atomic statements in the program, not the control flow that connects them to
 * each other.  Many different abstraction techniques work well in that setting,
 * and we will develop just one of them, *predicate abstraction*, which has been
 * used quite successfully in fully automated tools like SLAM and BLAST.  In
 * this pset, we'll write predicate abstractions manually, but the overall idea
 * can be proved sound once and for all. *)

(* First, here's a generic step relation parameterized over a few types and
 * relations. *)
Inductive step
          pc     (* This is the type of program-counter locations. *)
          state  (* This is the type of variable values. *)
          action (* Variables are changed by actions from this set. *)

          (actionOf : pc -> action -> pc -> Prop)
          (* This relation explains which actions can run from which program
           * counters, taking us to particular new program counters.  It's very
           * similar to the step relation of a deterministic finite automaton
           * (DFA), where "actions" would be characters of a finite alphabet. *)

          (doAction : action -> state -> state -> Prop)
          (* This relation explains which effects each action might have on
           * states. *)

  : pc * state -> pc * state -> Prop :=
| StepAction : forall pc1 act pc2 st1 st2,
  actionOf pc1 act pc2
  -> doAction act st1 st2
  -> step actionOf doAction (pc1, st1) (pc2, st2).
(* Notice the clean split between [doAction], for modeling the effects of
 * actions, and [actionOf], for explaining which actions a particular program
 * could trigger.  We will develop an abstraction technique that lets us focus
 * on [doAction] alone. *)

(* Here's a wrapper to create a proper transition system, given the relations
 * initial values for the program counter and state. *)
Definition actionSys pc state action (pc0 : pc) (st0 : state)
           (actionOf : pc -> action -> pc -> Prop)

           : trsys (pc * state) := {|
  Initial := {(pc0, st0)};
  Step := step actionOf doAction
|}.

(* Now, we begin defining predicate abstraction.  In general, this abstraction
 * will involve tracking the values of some finite set of logical *predicates*
 * over the state (program variables).  We will represent predicates with
 * strings, written here with the type synonym [var]. *)

(* This type captures a single assertion: a predicate is known to be either
 * true or false. *)
Record assertion := {
  AssumedPredicate : var;
  AssumedToBe : bool
}.

(* A *rule* gives us a way to deduce the *new* value of a predicate, given the
 * *old* values of other predicates, before some action. *)
Record rule := {
  Assumptions : list assertion;
  Conclusion : assertion
}.

(* A predicate abstraction gives us two key ingredients. *)

  (* We include these predicates, explaining the meaning of each by mapping it
   * to the logical notion of a predicate on states. *)

  Rules : fmap action (list rule)
  (* These rules show, for each action, how we may update the truth values of
   * the predicates we are tracking. *)
}.

(* This predicate formalizes the meaning of an assertion, given a map assigning
 * known truth values to (some of) the predicates. *)
Definition assertionHolds (st : fmap var bool) (asr : assertion) : bool :=

  | {| AssumedPredicate := p; AssumedToBe := b |} =>
    match st $? p with
    | None => false
    | Some true => b
    | Some false => negb b
    end
  end.

(* We can lift the operation to check that every assumption in a list holds,
 * instead of just one of them. *)
Fixpoint assumptionsHold (st : fmap var bool) (asms : list assertion) : bool :=
  match asms with
  | nil => true
  | asm :: asms' => assertionHolds st asm && assumptionsHold st asms'
  end.

(* Given a predicate state [st] from before running an action, where rule [r]
 * explains the effects of that action, *extend* predicate state [st'] with the
 * additional predicates that [r] allows us to deduce. *)
Definition applyRule (st st' : fmap var bool) (r : rule)

  | {| Assumptions := asns; Conclusion := conc |} =>
    if assumptionsHold st asns
    then st' $+ (conc.(AssumedPredicate), conc.(AssumedToBe))

  : fmap var bool :=
  match rs with
  | nil => st'
  | r :: rs' => applyRules st (applyRule st st' r) rs'
  end.

(* We use that operation to implement a step relation. *)
Inductive predicate_step pc action (actionOf : pc -> action -> pc -> Prop)
          (rules : fmap action (list rule))

                                                   end).
(* Note a crucial effect of the [match]: when an action is not in the rules map,
 * we conservatively pick the state with no asserted predicates. *)

(* Finally, we bring it all together into a transition system. *)
Definition predicate_abstract pc state action (pc0 : pc)

  | asm :: asms' => assertionAccurate predicates asm st

(* A rule is accurate when accuracy of its assumptions implies accuracy of its
 * conclusion, with respect to a particular relation [doIt] for performing some
